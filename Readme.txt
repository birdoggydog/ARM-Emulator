from the directory where emulator.py is:

type echo <pathname to .elf> and it will run the file.  You will see the status of all registers update in real time.

It only works on assembled arm assembly right now.

It's parsing correctly I believe.  It will also attempt to run a program.  Can't vouch for correctness at this juncture.
